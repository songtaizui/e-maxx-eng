#How to Contribute

###Source format

We use **Markdown** for source texts and convert them automatically with the help of small tool.

If you have **PHP** installed, you can run `compile.bat` or `compile.sh` file in the root folder - it will parse `src`
directory and convert all the files inside into HTML documents under the new folder `target`.

Formulas could be added thanks to `MathJax` library. Simply use `TeX` expressions inside single or double dollar marks `$`, for
example:

here is an inline equation: $P \ne NP$

And here is the formula in the separate block:

$$E = mc^{2}$$
