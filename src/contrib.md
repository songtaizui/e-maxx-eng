#How to Contribute

At least at first stage we are going to collaborate via means of github.

Generated pages are placed at [http://e-maxx-eng.appspot.com](http://e-maxx-eng.appspot.com).

And sources (to which you may want to contribute) are [here](http://github.com/e-maxx-eng/e-maxx-eng/src).

In order to make contribution consider the following steps:

###Using GitHub

1. Fork [source repository](https://github.com/e-maxx-eng/e-maxx-eng).
2. Add or modify files in `src` subfolder in Markdown format (you can do this in web-interface of github now).
3. Use `pull-request` feature to send the request for your changes to be merged.
4. Some time later the html page would appear at the site. If it don't happen, contact one of admins.

Please kindly refer to manuals on using `git` and `github` anywhere over internet.

###Source format

We use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) for source texts and
convert them automatically to HTML.
Some [extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/) features also could be used.

Formulas could be added thanks to `MathJax` library. Simply use `TeX` expressions inside single or double dollar marks `$`, for
example:

here is an inline equation: $P \ne NP$

And here is the formula in the separate block:

$$E = mc^{2}$$
