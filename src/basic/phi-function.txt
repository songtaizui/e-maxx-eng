#Euler's Totient Function

Also known as `phi-function` ($ \phi (n) $) it is just a count of coprimes (numbers,
having greatest common divisor of `1`) with `n` not exceeding `n` itself. Here `1` is regarded as a coprime to any number.

For example, `4` has two such coprimes - `1` and `2`. Any prime, `n` (like `7`) obviously have
`n-1` such coprimes.
